Warning:
--------------
After install Configurable Menu 1.1 or higher and if you have installed an older version, please delete the file, /home/USER/.cinnamon/configs/configurableMenu@lestcape  and then restart cinnamon, to allow display correctly the system buttons. This only a thing that need to be done when some key was changed, not always. Sorry for the inconvenients.

Cinnamon Installer
--------------
Configurable Menu is a applet of the Cinnamon desktop.
This desktop can be installed on different Linux distributions and therefore managing the packages
that Configurable Menu makes, needs the help of the Cinnamon Installer tool.

The main objective of Cinnamon Installer is that it may be implemented in most of the distributions.
However this is far from happening for now.
Any help will be well received.

You can found more information about Cinnamon Installer on the Cinnamon Installer website:
